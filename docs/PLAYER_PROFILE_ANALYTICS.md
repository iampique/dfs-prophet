- **Garbage Collection**: Automatic cleanup of temporary data

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
The analyzer handles errors gracefully:

- **Missing Data**: Uses defaults for missing player attributes
- **Vector Generation Failures**: Falls back to zero vectors
- **Clustering Failures**: Returns None instead of crashing
- **Prediction Errors**: Uses conservative estimates

### Logging
Comprehensive logging for debugging:

- **Performance Timing**: Track analysis duration
- **Error Tracking**: Detailed error messages
- **Cache Statistics**: Monitor cache effectiveness
- **Vector Quality**: Assess embedding quality

## Integration Points

### Vector Engine Integration
Uses the vector engine for player data:

```python
# Get player data from vector engine
results = await self.vector_engine.search_vectors(
    query_vector=[0.0] * 768,
    collection_type=CollectionType.REGULAR,
    limit=1000
)
```

### Embedding Generator Integration
Uses the embedding generator for vector creation:

```python
# Generate multi-vector embeddings
embeddings = await self.embedding_generator.generate_player_embedding(
    player, strategy=EmbeddingStrategy.STATISTICAL
)
```

### Configuration Integration
Uses centralized configuration:

```python
# Get vector weights and thresholds
self.vector_weights = self.settings.get_vector_weights()
self.performance_thresholds = self.settings.get_performance_thresholds()
```
